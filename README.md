    Note to fellow developers:   I am a new developer of only 3 years experience.  This project will take time and hopefully I learn some new skills for creating a web   application.  Thank you in advance to all of those who choose to contribute to my project.    
    This is a .Net MVC basic application only.  There are no rules currently on style of coding contributed.
